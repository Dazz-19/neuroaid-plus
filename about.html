      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>At NeuroAid+, our mission is simple but powerful: to empower non-verbal individuals with a voice — through affordable, AI-powered communication tools. We’re creating a bridge between patients and caregivers, one phrase at a time.</p>

    <section class="story">
      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Inspired by the challenges faced by people with speech impairments — and the high cost of existing AAC solutions — we set out to build something different. Something smarter, more caring, and open to all.</p>
      <p>We believe assistive technology shouldn't be a privilege. With the right blend of hardware and software, we’re changing how accessibility is done — from the ground up.</p>
